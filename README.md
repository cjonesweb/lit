# lit - Lightweight Image Tagger

lit is a Lightweight Image Tagger application that can be run locally via a rails-capable PC, or via a webhost. It will use sqlite to store tags and image metadata by default. You can override this. Rails is cool that way.

# Requirements:

* Ruby 2.3.0

* Rails 5.0.0.1
